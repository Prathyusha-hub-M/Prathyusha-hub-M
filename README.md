I'm a **Data Analyst** with 2 years of experience working with **SQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI**. I enjoy working with data, finding patterns, and turning numbers into meaningful stories that help teams make better decisions.

I’ve worked on cleaning and analyzing large datasets using **Pandas** and **NumPy**, and I use tools like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** to create simple and clear visualizations. I also use **SQL** for writing queries to work with databases like **MySQL**, **MS SQL Server**, and **SAP HANA**.

When it comes to reports and dashboards, I’ve built interactive visuals using **Power BI**, **Tableau**, and **Excel**. I’m also comfortable with tools like **Jupyter Notebooks**, **Google Colab**, **Git**, and **GitHub**.

I'm currently working on **sales data analysis**, applying **statistics**, **correlation analysis**, and **time series forecasting** to uncover trends and improve decision-making. I'm also familiar with **hypothesis testing**, **A/B testing**, and **natural language processing** using **NLTK**. Additionally, I have experience with cloud platforms like **Azure** and **GCP**.

Above all, I love learning and collaborating with others to turn data into insights. Feel free to check out my projects!
